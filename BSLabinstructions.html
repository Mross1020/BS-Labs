Key Terms:
* class
* bootstrap
* component

Objectives:
* Use BOOTSTRAP utilities and selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them.
* Use BOOTSTRAP utilities and selectors to change the layout, typography, and visual design of the webpage.
* Use the BOOTSTRAP utilities and selectors to control the size and spacing of HTML elements.
* Use BOOTSTRAP utilities and selectors to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

-----------------------------------------------------

Instructions: The HTML file provided has no style. Using ONLY Bootstrap CSS fill in the bootstrap class names necessary to style the page as indicated. You will have to fill in the CLASSES for each element. The Bootstrap CSS is already linked to the HTML file. This assignment provides practice in searching through the Bootstrap documentation. Take a look at the FinalProduct in the images folder to see what the page should look like when you're done. 

-----------------------------------------------------
PART 1:
* Step 1: Install the bootstrap dependency by running npm install in your IDE terminal.
* Step 2: In SECTION 1, add a SECONDARY (grey) background color to the BODY element by adding a class to the BODY tag that will change the background color.(See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/background/)
* Step 3: In SECTION 1, now that the background is all grey, add a LIGHT background color to the main-container DIV element by adding the bg-light class to the BODY tag. 
* Step 4: The banner image on top of the page doesn't fit, add a class that will make the image responsive to the window screen size. (See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/#responsive-images)
* Step 5: Center the page title "Dog Breeds" and add a margin bottom of 5. (See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding  AND  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/text/#text-alignment)

PART 2:
* Step 6: In SECTION 2, activate the bootstrap container class by adding "container" to the DIV's class. Also, add a margin bottom of 5 and change the font size to a level 5. (See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/text/#font-size)
* Step 7: In SECTION 3, add the "container" class to the small-dog DIV, then center the text in the DIV, add a margin bottom size 5 and change the font size to size 5 as well.
* Step 8: In SECTION 4, add the "container" class to the medium-dog DIV, then center the text in the DIV, add a margin bottom size 5 and change the font size to size 4.
* Step 9: In SECTION 5, add the "container" class to the large-dog DIV, then center the text in the DIV, add a margin bottom size 5 and change the font size to size 3.
* Step 10: In SECTIONS 4 and 5 assign columns with size and break points:
    * For SECTION 3, find the DIVs of Small Dog breed names and observe how each DIV in the ROW has a COLUMN class that will break when the screen is LARGE and change over to COLUMN size of 2.
    * In SECTION 4, for each DIV of Medium dog breeds in the ROW... assign a COLUMN class that will break when the screen is MEDIUM and assign a COLUMN size of 4.
    * In SECTION 5, for each DIV of LARGE dog breeds in the ROW... assign a COLUMN class that will break when the screen is MEDIUM and assign a COLUMN size of 6.
    * (See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#column-breaks)

PART 3:
* Step 11: In SECTION 6, for the three DIVs that have an ID of "card-#" assign a "card" class AND a class that will change the background color to SECONDARY. (See documentation for CARD: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#about)
* Step 12: In SECTION 6, change the btn-dark class on all three BUTTON links to an outline class, choose a color from the documentation. (See documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/#outline-buttons) 
* Step 13: In SECTION 6, find the 3 DIVs inside the DIV with a class of ROW... add a COLUMN class to each DIV that will break when the screen is a MEDIUM size resulting in stacking of the DIVs. 
* Step 14: In SECTION 7, align the text in the FOOTER to center.
